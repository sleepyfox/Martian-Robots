Martian Robots
==============
The original problem specification is contained in the file MartianRobots.pdf helpfully provided by RedBadger. 

Prerequisites:
Node and npm with the following modules:
coffee-script
jasmine-node 

You can run the code with:

    jasmine-node test-robots.spec.coffee

I set up a watchr file (robots.watchr) so that the tests are run automatically every time you save a file in your editor, simply run watchr (if you have it installed) with:
    
    watchr robots.watchr
