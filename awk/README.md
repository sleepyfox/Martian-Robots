A version of the Martian rover problem, in its original Thoughtworks form. To run the program simply type at the command line:

  awk -f robots.awk problem.dat

The final positions of all robots are shown. Because the original problem didn't specify what happens to the robot if it exceeds the boundary of the grid, the size of the grid (the first line of the problem file) can effectively be ignored.
